Hi there! You've found my passion project in Unity, C#! I am an enjoyer of multiple TTRPGs (Tabletop role-playing games) such as DnD (Dungeons and Dragons), Stars Without Number, and recently Lancer! 
My goal for this project is to develop a 3D interactive map visualizer for the GM to create environments, pre-make encounters, NPCs, PCs, and Creatures, then save them before, after, or during a session (and for players to interact with their own character).
There are other similar tools out there, be they web-based apps or using a game engine such as this. I could have used any one of them, but I wanted to create something that touches my interests in game development, 3D art creation, and TTRPGs.

There is a lot I don't know, and I'm actively learning as I work on this project: system design/interactions, project planning, scalability, and loads more!
